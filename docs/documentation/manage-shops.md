{: .no_toc }

In Aisleron, a Shop represents a physical location where you can buy products. A Shop is laid out by Aisle, with products sorted into the Shop Aisles. You can set up multiple shops with different layouts; needed products will be displayed in all shops.

Frequently used Shops can be pinned to the navigation drawer for easy access. Pinned and unpinned shops can be accessed from the *All Shops* page. To access *All Shops*, tap the hamburger menu to open the navigation drawer. Next, tap the *All Shops* menu item under the *Shops* category.

To add, edit, or delete a shop, see the instructions below.

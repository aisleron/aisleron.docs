Aisleron uses a navigation drawer to navigate around the app. Open the navigation drawer by tapping the hamburger menu in the top left corner. The drawer contains three sections:

{:toc}
* TOC

# Home Section 
The *Home* Drawer Section is the first section in the navigation drawer. This is where you manage which products are needed or in stock at home. The section has three lists, based on product status. All three lists share the same aisle configuration for your home.

***In Stock***: Display products that are expected to be [*In Stock*](/docs/documentation/product-list#in-stock-list) at home. Use this list as a guide when preparing your shopping list.

***Needed***: Display products that are [*Needed*](/docs/documentation/product-list#needed-list) at home and needs to be picked up from a shop. Use this list to review your shopping list.

***All Items***: Display both [*In Stock* and *Needed*](/docs/documentation/product-list#all-items-list) products in a single list.  

# Shops Section
The *Shops* drawer section lists all pinned shops, and the *All Shops* menu item. Tap a pinned shop to see that shop's [*Needed*](/docs/documentation/product-list#shop-list) products. Tap the [*All Shops*](/docs/documentation/manage-shops) to manage shops.

# Other Options
From this section, you can access the application's [*Settings*](/docs/documentation/settings), and the *About* page.

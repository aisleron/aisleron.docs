# Aisleron Themes
{: .no_toc }

Aisleron supports three theme options that can be selected based on user preference. These options are:
* *Light Theme*, with white backgrounds and blue accent colors;
* *Dark Theme*, with darker backgrounds and orange accent colors;
* *System Theme*, which will automatically pick a theme based on system settings. 

You can set your preferred theme under [*Display Options*](/docs/documentation/settings#display-options) on the [*Settings*](/docs/documentation/settings) page.

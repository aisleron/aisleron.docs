# Product Status

An Aisleron Product can have one of two statuses:  
* **In Stock**: You have the product available at home or do not need to buy it. Products that are *In Stock* will be displayed on the Home *In Stock* and *All Items* lists.
* **Needed**: You need to buy the product from a shop. PRoducts that are *Needed* will be displayed on the  Home *Needed* and *All Items* lists, and in any Shop lists

## Changing Product Status
There are two ways to toggle a product between *Needed* and *In Stock*:  

**Checking/Unchecking**: Tap the check box on the product shopping list entry. *Checked* means the product is in stock, *Unchecked* means the product is needed.

**Swiping**: Swipe a product  shopping list entry left or right to toggle the product status. Both directions perform the same action so it swipe direction doesn't matter.

By default, a notification is displayed whenever a product's status is toggled between *Needed* and *In Stock*. To turn off this notification, turn on [Hide status change message]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/documentation/settings#shopping-list-options) in *Settings*.

The Product List is the main page of Aisleron, and displays products based on the currently selected list's filter. This page is used to keep track of *In Stock* and *Needed* products, and can be [organized](/docs/documentation/organize-lists) based on the unique layout of your home and shops.

[Products](/docs/documentation/manage-products) and [Aisles](/docs/documentation/manage-aisles) can also be managed from this page.

## List Types

The product list can display the following list types: 

### In Stock List

Displays products that are expected to be in stock or available at home. Use this list as a guide when preparing your shopping list; review each aisle's *In Stock* products, and [move the product to the *Needed* list](/docs/documentation/product-status) if required. Changing a product to *Needed* will remove it from the *In Stock* list. This list uses the *Home* aisle layout.

### Needed List

Displays products that need to be picked up from a shop. Use this list to review your shopping list. If a product is no longer needed, [move the product to the *In Stock* list](/docs/documentation/product-status). Changing a product to *In Stock* will remove it from the *Needed* list. This list uses the *Home* aisle layout.

### All Items List

Displays both *In Stock* and *Needed* products in a single list. Products will remain on this list even when [changing between *Needed* and *In Stock*](/docs/documentation/product-status). This list uses the *Home* aisle layout.

### Shop List 

Displays products that need to be picked up from the given shop. While shopping, [tick off products](/docs/documentation/product-status) to remove it from the list. Each shop can have a unique aisle layout.

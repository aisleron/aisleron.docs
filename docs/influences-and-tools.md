# Influences and Tools

Aisleron Shopping List is a little passion project to first and foremost fill a gap I experienced in most other shopping list apps. It's been a great learning experience, one that would not have been possible without other open-source projects to take inspiration from. These include, but are not limited to:

Next up, a list of some of the tools I found most useful as part of the development process:
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), obviously...
* [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy), to design various application logos and icons.
* [Nextcloud Deck](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck), to keep track of issues and features.
* [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), to build and manage the online documentation.
